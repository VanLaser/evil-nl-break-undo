;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Simple minor mode that breaks evil's undo sequence when the buffer
;; is changed over a line boundary.
;;

;;; Usage:
;;
;; Add the mode to the buffers you want (Evil should be already enabled there).
;; For example:
;;
;; (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'evil-nl-break-undo-mode)
;; (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'evil-nl-break-undo-mode)

;;; Code:

(require 'evil)

(defvar evil-break-undo-regexp "\n"
  "REGEXP used to break an evil undo sequence.
The search takes place on the text range that is being changed.")

(defun evil-nl-break-undo--maybe (beg end &optional len)
  "Local hook run before and after the buffer is changed.
Checks if a newline was either removed, or inserted, and breaks
the current evil undo step."
  (when (and (not (minibufferp))
	     (not evil-want-fine-undo)
	     (evil-insert-state-p)
	     (< beg end)
	     (save-excursion
	       (save-match-data		;don't spoil user searches
		 (goto-char beg) (re-search-forward evil-break-undo-regexp end t))))
    (evil-end-undo-step)
    (evil-echo "Break undo")
    (evil-start-undo-step)))

    (add-hook 'before-change-functions    #'evil-nl-break-undo--maybe nil t)
    (add-hook 'after-change-functions     #'evil-nl-break-undo--maybe nil t))

(defun evil-nl-break-undo--disable ()
    (remove-hook 'before-change-functions    #'evil-nl-break-undo--maybe t)
    (remove-hook 'after-change-functions     #'evil-nl-break-undo--maybe t))
